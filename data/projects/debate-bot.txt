Title: 'Debate Bot'
Languages: 'JavaScript, Python, TikTok'
Description: 
'A revenue generating service using third-party applcations such as Minecraft, Tikfinity, and TikTok livestreaming

The stream depicts a battle between two bots, each representing one side of a debate.
Viewers can set back the progress of either of the bots through donations and interactions.
The most profitable debate was 'Kamala Harris' vs. 'Donald Trump.'

Through the use of a Python mouse/keyboard automation script, the service was able to run optimally 24/7.
Viewer count was tracked and the stream-reset algorithm was tailored to gather 200+ concurrent viewers.

Plans to scale to multiple computers and accounts weren't plausible due to TikTok's guidelines.'
